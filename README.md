As part of Harvard’s PLD program, I frequently work with PDF documents and often need to translate selected text to streamline my reading and comprehension. However, existing PDF readers require a cumbersome process of copying text, switching to an LLM tool for translation, and returning to the document.

To address this, I aim to create a streamlined PDF reader that integrates translation functionality directly within the app. While I’m a programmer, I have no prior experience with Mac app development or PyQt. Nevertheless, I want to leverage tools like Cursor and other AI-assisted coding solutions to explore the potential of LLMs in real-world software engineering tasks.

This project aligns with my belief that the best way to learn is through practical application, and it serves as both a learning opportunity and a demonstration of integrating LLMs into useful tools.
